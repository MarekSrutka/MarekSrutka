# Hello, I'm Marek Srutka ðŸ‘‹

## Mid-Level iOS Developer with a Zeal for Building Impactful Apps

Boasting **3.5 years of immersive experience** in iOS development, I stand as a committed professional poised at the sweet spot between emerging talent and seasoned expertise. My portfolio is a testament to my proficiency in **UIKit**, **SwiftUI**, **CoreData**, **ARKit**, **AVKit**, and **MapKit**. This diverse toolkit empowers me to forge apps that are not just visually appealing but are robust and user-centric at their core.

### About Me

Coding for me is more than a job; it's a passion that extends into my after-hours. There's nothing I enjoy more than retreating into my office, letting music fill the space, and coding away into the night. This dedication has been a key driver in my continuous growth and my ability to stay in tune with the latest in app development.

### Projects

I've had the privilege of contributing to various projects that have pushed me to broaden my skill set and challenge my capabilities. Recently, I've started using GitHub more actively, pushing my new projects that serve as a practical recap of everything I've learned. This initiative not only demonstrates my commitment to constant learning but also allows me to share my journey and the results of my work with a broader community.

- **CSOB Smart**: As an external iOS Developer in a dynamic team of professionals, I contributed to the transformation of a banking application from **UIKit** to **SwiftUI**. This project involved intricate work with deep links and the creation of new features, enhancing the user experience and modernizing the app's architecture. This experience was not only a testament to my technical abilities but also an opportunity to refine my skills in teamwork, problem-solving, and innovative thinking in a real-world setting.

- **Arthur**: This project was a fascinating exploration into combining **ARKit** and **MapKit** to present landmarks within a user's vicinity. It involved displaying landmarks in augmented reality, indicating their location relative to the user, and drawing routes on the map for navigation purposes. This application not only honed my skills in augmented reality and geolocation but also provided users with an interactive and informative way to explore their surroundings.

- **Progresguru**: This project was an exciting opportunity to work with **AVKit**, facilitating users to listen to audiobooks. It included features like purchasing books through iPay, downloading books to the device, and enabling offline listening. This venture not only enhanced my technical skills but also offered valuable insights into integrating payment solutions and managing offline content.
